The reality is of course is much more complex but I am trying to offer a simple but very useful framework for people who want to start a startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Should you even start?

If you are thinking of starting a startup, I think it may be good to double-check if it's really the best path for you.

Some questions you can yourself:
- What does company success look like for you?
  - Do you want to reach a specific goal or milestone?
  - Do you want the company to outlive you?
  - Is there a mission for a company that can server as an infinite goal and purpose?
  - In which cases you will consider selling your company a success? Are there any?
- Are there better non-startup paths for my goals?  
  For example, startup may not be the best or most reliable way to earn a certain amount of money in the period of 10 years.

What to be aware of:

1) If taken seriously, it's a long-term endevour
- Unless you give up, you will likely work on this startup for a double-digit number of years. Please realize that it's a long-term endevour.
- If you start a startup, it will likely consume a lot of your mindspace, you will likely think about it often in the shower, as you are trying to fall asleep, while you are on vacation etc
- Instead of consciously starting an official company, you can casually work on interesting ideas or projects in parallel to your main work or main career pathway. If one of the ideas takes off, you can later decide whether to make it an offical company.

2) There are a couple of legal things to think through around intellectual property being created
- If someone will be working on an idea with you, please consider that later legally they can legally claim a part of your startup equity. I recommend to either sign standard legal spaperwork clearly stating who will own what intellectual property with the later company or be ready that each collaborater may request an equal share of your company.
- If you are employed at another company in parallel, especially a tech company, they may claim your new company's intellectual property as your own.

I think one of the best reasons to start a startup is if you "can't NOT start a startup". 😂😂😂
If you really can't see yourself working for another company, being a freelancer, work in a government, or doing something else.

## 2 main ways to start brainstorming

I see two main most common ways successful startups usually are founded:

1) Idea First -> Co-Founders Later

You start with a concrete idea and you go and find collaborators to help you with your specific idea
Examples: Google, Facebook, Amazon, NVIDIA, SpaceX

2) Co-Founders first -> Idea Later

You have a good friends or a team you want to start a company with and you go through various ideas or pivots
Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Stripe

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Suggested supplementary lists before brainstorming

Before starting a startup I think it can help you to generate some of the following lists:

1. Your strengths & resources
- What are you good at? what are you world-class at? what are you strengths? what are your superpowers?
- What areas / spaces / domains do you have expertise, insights, network, assets, or other resources in?

2. What will keep you going and improving
- What do you enjoy doing?
- What areas / spaces / domains are you curious or passionate about?

3. What target audiences could you "marry" yourself into for the next double-digit number of years?

This is very important because you will likely need to constantly talk to such people, deeply care about their problems and needs, and constantly update your worldview.
- What types of people do you know very deeply?
- What types of people do you deeply enjoy helping or would likely enjoy helping?

4. Your "North Stars"
- What global, local, or foreign local companies inspire you? what is it that you love, admire, or respect about those companies?

5. Your vision for the world

Startup with vision give enormous amount of energy and purpose to founders, employees, and anyone who will want your company to succeed.
- How would you like the world to change?  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## High-level brainstorming you can do individually or separately first

I think you can start generating ideas by generating a list of known and hypothethical problems:

1) List personal problems and needs you would like a solution for
2) List problems and needs you know or think target audiences you know about would like a solution for
3) Start from technologies you are excited about it and generate a list of potential problems & needs they may be useful for
4) What's something that may be just fun or interesting to try out?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to brainstorm socially

If you already have co-founders, after you brainstorm separately, you can brainstorm together.

If you are brainstorming with other people, please never attack or criticize ideas. Always to try to help develop ideas.
"Yes, and" rule from improv comedy teaches to ignore internal instinct to come up with what's wrong and help your collaborator to build on what's given no matter how "bad" or "difficult" the initial input was.

You can organize "bad ideas brainstorming" meetings with your co-founders with the aim to generate only bad ideas. It's a lot of fun!
Always list all ideas, people should not become afraid of their ideas during any brainstorming. You can always filter out, deprioritize, or shelf what you think are truly bad ideas sometimes after the meeting.
"Bad" ideas are often quickly convertable to very innovative and creative good ideas.

I strongly recommend brainstorming in diverse and awesome physical spaces in person.
If you are brainstorming online, do what you can to make the physical and online environment super comfortable and ideally fun and playful.

## Prioritizing ideas

[TO BE ADDED LATER]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Validating ideas

After brainstorming and prioritizing ideas it's very important to validate your ideas.

For that, talk to real target users.
Ask them about related problems and how do they already solve them.
Avoid talking about whether they would use your offering. They are likely to overstate their interest not to have a conflict with you.
Focus on talking about the past and present. You are more likely to be closer to truth this way.
The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick is a very short book on this topic that I loved.

Do interest tests with real prices.

You can create a website, an Instagram account, or other mock/fake offering with a listed price and ask people to click something to express their interest.
E.g. ask them to leave their email or phone number for pre-order information.
This way you can estimate interest without spending much money. You can spend virtually zero dollars and quickly validate an idea this way.
