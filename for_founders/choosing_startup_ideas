The reality is of course is much more complex but I am trying to offer a simple but very useful framework for people who want to start a startup.

If you are thinking of starting a startup, I think it may be good to double-check if it's really the best path for you.

Some questions you can yourself:
- What does company success look like for you?
  - Do you want to reach a specific goal or milestone?
  - Do you want the company to outlive you?
  - Is there a mission for a company that can server as an infinite goal and purpose?
  - In which cases you will consider selling your company a success? Are there any?

What to be aware of:
- To succeed on a global scale you will likely need a double-digit number of years
- It will likely consume a lot of your mindspace, you will likely think about it often in the shower, as you are trying to fall asleep, while you are on vacation etc

I see two main most common ways successful startups usually are founded:

1) You have a concrete idea and you find collaborators to help you with your specific idea
Examples: Google, Facebook, Amazon, NVIDIA, SpaceX

2) You have a good friends or a team you want to start a company with and you go through various ideas or pivots
Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Stripe


Before starting a startup I think it can help you to make the following lists:
- what are you good at? what are you world-class at? what are you strengths? what are your superpowers?
- what do you enjoy doing?
- what do you have expertise in, even if it's very niche (e.g. only in your city)?
- what types of people do you know very deeply?
- what types of people do you deeply enjoy helping or would likely enjoy helping?
  this is important because you will likely need to constantly talk to such people, deeply care about their problems and needs, and constantly update your worldview
