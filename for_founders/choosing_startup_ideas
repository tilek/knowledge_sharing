I see two main most common ways successful startups usually are founded:

1) You have a concrete idea and you find collaborators to help you with your specific idea
Examples: Google, Facebook, Amazon, NVIDIA, SpaceX

2) You have a good friends or a team you want to start a company with and you go through various ideas or pivots
Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Stripe

The reality is of course is much more complex but I am trying to offer a simple but very useful framework.
