The reality is of course is much more complex but I am trying to offer a simple but very useful framework for people who want to start a startup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Should you even start?

If you are thinking of starting a startup, I think it may be good to double-check if it's really the best path for you.

Some questions you can yourself:
- What does company success look like for you?
  - Do you want to reach a specific goal or milestone?
  - Do you want the company to outlive you?
  - Is there a mission for a company that can server as an infinite goal and purpose?
  - In which cases you will consider selling your company a success? Are there any?

What to be aware of:
- To succeed on a global scale you will likely need a double-digit number of years
- It will likely consume a lot of your mindspace, you will likely think about it often in the shower, as you are trying to fall asleep, while you are on vacation etc

## 2 main ways to start brainstorming

I see two main most common ways successful startups usually are founded:

1) Idea First -> Co-Founders Later

You start with a concrete idea and you go and find collaborators to help you with your specific idea
Examples: Google, Facebook, Amazon, NVIDIA, SpaceX

2) Co-Founders first -> Idea Later

You have a good friends or a team you want to start a company with and you go through various ideas or pivots
Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Airbnb, Stripe

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Suggested supplementary lists before brainstorming

Before starting a startup I think it can help you to make the following lists:

- what are you good at? what are you world-class at? what are you strengths? what are your superpowers?
- what areas / spaces / domains do you have expertise, insights, network, assets, or other resources in?

- what do you enjoy doing?
- what areas / spaces / domains are you curious or passionate about?

- what types of people do you know very deeply?
- what types of people do you deeply enjoy helping or would likely enjoy helping?
  this is important because you will likely need to constantly talk to such people, deeply care about their problems and needs, and constantly update your worldview

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## High-level brainstorming you can do individually or separately first

I think you can start generating ideas by generating a list of known and hypothethical problems:

1) List personal problems and needs you would like a solution for
2) List problems and needs you know or think target audiences you know about would like a solution for
3) Start from technologies you are excited about it and generate a list of potential problems & needs they may be useful for
4) What's something that may be just fun or interesting to try out?

## How to brainstorm socially

If you already have co-founders, after you brainstorm separately, you can brainstorm together.

If you are brainstorming with other people, please never attack or criticize ideas. Always to try to help develop ideas.
"Yes, and" rule from improv comedy teaches to ignore internal instinct to come up with what's wrong and help your collaborator to build on what's given no matter how "bad" or "difficult" the initial input was.

You can organize "bad ideas brainstorming" meetings with your co-founders with the aim to generate only bad ideas. It's a lot of fun!
Always list all ideas, people should not become afraid of their ideas during any brainstorming. You can always filter out, deprioritize, or shelf what you think are truly bad ideas sometimes after the meeting.
"Bad" ideas are often quickly convertable to very innovative and creative good ideas.

I strongly recommend brainstorming in diverse and awesome physical spaces in person.
If you are brainstorming online, do what you can to make the physical and online environment super comfortable and ideally fun and playful.
