# Why is it important to know your strengths?

I believe understading your strengths is extremely important to help you focus on skills you want to develop for better career and other parts of life too.

For example, in dating you can use strengths to find your mate, attract them, have great experiences with them and develop your relationship with them, if it becomes relevant.
